Okay, I will review the provided code snippet as a Senior Code Reviewer.

❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum() {return a + b;}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ **Undefined Variables**: The variables `a` and `b` are not declared or passed as arguments to the `sum` function.
This will result in a `ReferenceError` if `a` or `b` are not defined in an outer scope (e.g., globally), or lead to
unpredictable behavior if they exist in a less controlled scope.
* ❌ **Lack of Reusability**: A `sum` function should ideally take the numbers it needs to sum as parameters. By not
accepting arguments, this function is not reusable and depends on external, implicitly defined variables, which is an
anti-pattern for maintainable and predictable code.
* ❌ **Unclear Intent**: Without parameters, it's unclear what `a` and `b` are supposed to represent or where they are
expected to come from, hindering readability.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
/**
* Calculates the sum of two numbers.
* @param {number} num1 - The first number to sum.
* @param {number} num2 - The second number to sum.
* @returns {number} The sum of num1 and num2.
*/
function sum(num1, num2) {
return num1 + num2;
}

// Example usage:
// console.log(sum(5, 3)); // Output: 8
// console.log(sum(-10, 20)); // Output: 10
```

💡 Improvements:
* ✔ **Defined Parameters**: The function now explicitly accepts `num1` and `num2` as parameters, making its inputs clear
and preventing `ReferenceError` issues.
* ✔ **Enhanced Reusability**: The function can now be called with any two numbers, making it a truly reusable utility.
* ✔ **Improved Readability & Maintainability**: The code is more explicit about its inputs, which greatly enhances
understanding and makes it easier to maintain or debug.
* ✔ **Documentation**: Added JSDoc comments to clearly describe the function's purpose, its parameters, and what it
returns, adhering to best practices for code documentation.

**Final Note:**
Always aim for functions that are self-contained and explicitly define their dependencies (inputs) through parameters.
This promotes modularity, testability, and reduces unexpected side effects, leading to more robust and scalable
applications.
